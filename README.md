# Cards app

A small web app for creating profile cards.

On the backend, PHP 7.4 & MySQL 8.0 are required. However, the app can serve a sample set of cards in offline mode if server requests fail.

There is room for further development, for example custom profile pictures, or an alternate server on Node.js, so an update might come one day.
